# Currency Data Analysis and Forecasting

The current project explores through various currencies and in the end produces forecasts for `USD Cash Inflow`.

It is structured in the following way

- `notebooks/01-ns-initial-data-analysis.ipynb` - Contains Initial Analysis of the different currencies, common problems, etc.

- `notebooks/02-ns-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb` - EDA for the `USD Cash Inflow` which is present in the dataset. Visualizations helping establish seasonality, distributions by different factors, etc.

- `notebooks/03-ns-cash-inflow.ipynb` - Forecast Analysis of the `USD Cash Inflow` column in the dataset. 

- `next-steps.md` - A markdown document containing ideas and thoughts on how can the process be extended in case new levels of granularity are introduced to the dataset, as well as some infrastructure thoughts. The document is also present as a `pdf` output file.
